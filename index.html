            <h2>The Heart Behind Jacoboni's Plates</h2>
            <p>At Jacoboni’s Plates, every dish carries the spirit of family and tradition. Our journey began in our grandmother’s cozy kitchen, where the rich aroma of simmering sauces and freshly baked bread filled the air. Nonna Jacoboni taught our family not only the art of Italian cooking but also the joy of sharing love through food. Her recipes, passed down through generations, have inspired us to bring her passion to life in our restaurant. Jacoboni’s Plates is our way of honoring her legacy and sharing her timeless flavors with the Metro Detroit community. From our family to yours, welcome to our table.</p>
